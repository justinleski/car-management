# Car Management Sytsem
### Purpose
This program intends to utilize `linked lists` to read and write from a file to sort, manage, store, and remove cars based on specifications.

### SKills Learned
Through the creation of this project, I sharpened my skills on creating `makefiles` and challenged my understanding of how linked lists function and behave.

### Challeneges Faced
Starting from high-level languages got me used to not considering the ins and outs of memory allocation as it was all taken care of for me. Thanks to Valgrind and a lot of effort, I was able to truly mould and strengthen my understanding in how a computer allocates memory; this was by far the most difficult part of the project.
